        <p class="display-5 fw-bold h2">My Work</p>
        <p>The applications that I produce lie at the intersection of pop culture and practicality. I first identify a need or a problem, then research popular trends in pop culture. With the two in mind, I identify meaningful ways to incorporate the trends into my application in a meaningful way. My hope in doing this is that individuals are exposed to the art of programming and are encouraged to pursue their own projects.</p>
        <p class="display-5 fw-bold h2">Thoughtful Design</p>
        <p>Thoughtful design is crucial to the success of any application. It requires creativity, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of the needs of the user. By taking the time to carefully consider the design of an application, I'm able to create products that are both functional and enjoyable to use. My goal with each application I make is to carefully craft a unique experience for users to enjoy and interact with.</p>
        <p class="display-5 fw-bold h2">Programming is Art</p>
        <p>Like any other artistic medium, programming is a way for individuals to express their creative ideas. It's a way of creating and building things that haven't existed, doing so through a combination of creative problem-solving and technical skill. It's a way of turning abstract ideas into concrete, functional applications that everyone can enjoy. Whether you're creating a simple website or the next big thing, programming is a way for you to bring your vision to life and share it with the world.</p>
