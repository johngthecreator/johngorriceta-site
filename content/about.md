<p class="lead">Hi, my name is John Gorriceta and I am a computer science student at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I am deeply passionate about the potential for technology to change people's lives for the better and I believe that software has the power to make a positive impact on the world. As a computer science student, I am constantly learning about new technologies and ways to use them to solve problems and make things easier for people. One of my main goals is to use my skills and knowledge to develop software that helps to decentralize education and make it more accessible to people all around the world. I believe that education is a fundamental right and I want to do my part to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
